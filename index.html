    <h2>Information about the Sun:</h2>
    <p>The Sun is one of the most important things in this whole universe. It is like a tennis ball, but 100000000000 x hotter and 1000000000000 x bigger! It is literally a perfect ball of hydrogen and helium. The sun produces light and radiation, and is the most important source of any energy to literally any planet in the solar system! It is the largest ‘thing’ in the solar system. Life on this planet and any other wouldn’t exist without this beast. From plants, to literally Us(Humans), we all need the Sun to survive. There is a very important process, called nuclear fusion, which is about our next topic:</p>

    <p>Here are some facts about the sun</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🌞The Sun is 4.5 billion years old!!!</li>
        <li>🌞The Sun’s light reaches the Earth in 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>🌞The element helium got its name from the Sun.</li>
        <li>🌞The sun is the closest star to the Earth.</li>
        <li>🌞The surface of The Sun is 5,505 °C.</li>
        <li>🌞Sometimes spots on The Sun erupt and mess with our mobile phone signals.</li>
        <li>🌞Many ancient civilisations thought The Sun was a God.</li>

    <h3>Information about Solar Panels:</h3>
    <p>The energy of the sun is now able to be captured by engineers and scientists. The source is the Sun- what we just talked about. Fusion of nuclear fuel produces solar energy. The sun undergoes nuclear fusion which is the process of the Sun burning the hydrogen atoms, which make the helium atoms. The Sun fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen to make helium per day! The protons of hydrogen atoms fiercely collide during this nuclear fusion, fusing to form helium atoms at the sun's core. This procedure is referred to as a proton-proton chain reaction, and it produces a significant quantity of energy.

    <h3>Information about Nuclear Energy:</h3>
    <p>Nuclear energy is very powerful but also very dangerous. The energy it produces is more than 2 times as powerful then fossil fuels but the radiation it produces can melt people if they don't have the proper equipment. That's also why nuclear power plants have a perimeter that you can't go in without having equipment. But even though the radiation is this bad, people all around the world still use nuclear energy. People say even though nuclear energy is very bad because of radiation, the plus side is that it produces a lot of energy. Some people also say that the best and also worst part of nuclear energy is that it is not renewable. Did you know 51% of Ontario's energy comes from nuclear energy. That shows the power of nuclear energy. If that's not enough to convince you then 20% of America's energy is also nuclear.</p>
